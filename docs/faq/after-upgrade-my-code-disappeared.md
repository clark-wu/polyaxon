Polyaxon provides several ways for storing the [logs](/configuration/custom-logs-storage/), the default method uses a local path on the host node. 
This is option is sufficient if you are trying the platform and don't want to deal with extra configuration steps, however, when using Polyaxon in a production mode, 
you should definitely look at the other persistence strategies.

When the user uses a local path to store logs, a couple of things could happen:
 * The host node might be deleted, or replaced, and all logs will be deleted as well.
 * If the user scales the platform, the API, scheduler, and other component might be deployed on different nodes, which means that only some of these components will be able to access the logs.
 * If the API is replicated on different node same thing could happen as well.
 * After an upgrade all your component might be scheduled on a different node.
 
Polyaxon provides several options to make robust persistent of your logs.
