You should provide a callback URL: [Domain/IP]/oauth/gitlab

## Update your deployment config file

Use your client id and secret token to update your deployment config file.

```yaml
auth:
  gitlab:
    enabled: true
    clientId:
    clientSecret:
```

If you have an on-premise Gitlab installation you can additionally provide your Gitlab url:

```yaml
auth:
  gitlab:
    enabled: true
    clientId:
    clientSecret:
    url: privateUrl
```
